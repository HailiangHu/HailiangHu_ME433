One slider was used in the slider to ajust the threshold of R - G. 
The position of COM was sent to PIC to the parameter 'qq'.
The control logic is :
if(qq>400){
                    OC1RS = 100;
                    OC2RS = 4000;
                }
                else if(qq>330){
                    OC1RS = 1000;
                    OC2RS = 4000;
                }
                else if(qq<240){
                    OC1RS = 4000;
                    OC2RS = 100;
                }
                else if(qq<310){
                    OC1RS = 4000;
                    OC2RS = 1000;
                }    
                else{
                    OC1RS = 4000;
                    OC2RS = 4000;
                }
                
            }

The full speed is 6000.
When qq is a little away from the center point, one wheel will slow down to make the robot turn back.
When qq is far from the center point, one wheel will nearly stop to make a obvious turn.
The reason I didn't use the full speed is to make sure the robot run slowly and won't rush out of boundary.
